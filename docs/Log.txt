Log

Syntax: #log {mode} {filename}

The log command will log all data received in the scrolling region to the specified filename. The mode is either o (ovewrite) or a (append).

With the config command you can specify the data type used for the log file. These are: raw (prints escape codes as well), plain (strips escape codes), html (converts escape color codes to html color codes).

Example: #log o mylog.html
Asuming you have html logging enabled (the default) this will write all the mud output to mylog.html.
