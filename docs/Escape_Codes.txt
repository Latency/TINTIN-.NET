Escape Codes

The escape character in tintin is the backslash: \ which can be used in combination with several characters to create escape
codes.

 \a   will beep the terminal.
 \b   will send a backspace character.
 \c   will send a control character, \ca for ctrl-a.
 \e   will start an escape sequence.
 \n   will send a line feed.
 \r   will send a carriage return.
 \t   will send a tab.
 \x   will print an hexadecimal character value, \xFF for example.
 \x7B will send the '{' character.
 \x7D will send the '}' character.
 \0   will print a 6 bit octal character value, \077 for example.
 \\   will print a single \.

Ending a line with a \ will stop tintin from appending a line feed when using #showme, #send or #line.

To escape arguments in an alias use %%0 %%1 %%2 etc.
