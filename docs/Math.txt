Math

Syntax: #math {variable} {mathematical expression}

See the mathexp manual entry for a list of operators that can be used.

Math allows you to do calculations and store the result in the given variable. It also allows for string and regexp
comparisons.

Example: #math sumvar {(1 + 1) * 10}
This basic operation would store the result (which is 20) in sumvar.
