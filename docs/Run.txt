Run

Syntax: #run {session name} {shell commands}

The run command runs a shell command interactively. When the shell command terminates so will the session much like a normal session.

You can run any shell command, wether that be ssh, telnet, python, php, perl or ruby.

This would create a ssh session to a *nix server with full tintin scripting capabilities.

Example: #run python python;#act {^cmd %1} {%1};print "cmd #showme <118>Hello World!"
This would start a python shell, create a trigger to execute any text preceded by 'cmd ', and print a red colored line.
