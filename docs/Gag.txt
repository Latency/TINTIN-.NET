Gag

Syntax: #gag {message}

The #gag command does the same thing as #substitute {message} {.} and adds the message to your substitution list. A gagged message will no longer be displayed.

See the help file on Action for more information.

Example: #gag {%iTwinkie chats}
If Twinkie is an annoying person, he'll be a gagged annoying person with this gag. The %i at the start makes the gag case incensitive, so if Twinkie logs in as TWINKIE the gag will still work.

Notice: You can remove gags with the #ungag command.
