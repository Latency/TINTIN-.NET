Ticker

Syntax: #ticker {name} {commands} {interval}

The name part can be whatever you want it to be, and is only required for the unticker command. The commands will be executed every x amount of seconds, which is specified in the interval part.

Example: #ticker {autosave} {save} {300}
This would make tintin execute the save command every 300 seconds.

Notice: You can remove ticks with the #untick command.
