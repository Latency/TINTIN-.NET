Bell

Syntax: #bell

This command rings the terminal bell. It's obsolete and should be avoided, instead use #showme {\a} to send the terminal
alarm character to the terminal.

Example: #action {Bubba tells you} {#showme {\a\}
If you aren't watching the screen this could be useful if you don't want to miss out on a conversation with Bubba.
Alternatively you can use #system to play a sound file.

Some terminals will allow you to use VT100 Operating System Commands to change the terminal's icon name which can be used as
a visual alert.

Example: #action {Bubba tells you} {#showme {\e]1;New Message\e\\};#delay 10 #showme {\e]1;TinTin# client\e\\}
