Alias

Syntax: #alias {name} {commands}

The #alias command can be used to shorten up long or oftenly used commands. The %1-99 variables are substituted from the
arguments when using an alias and represent the 1st till 99th word which can be used in the commands part of the alias.

If %0 is used it will contain all arguments, if the commands part only exists of a single word, variables are automatically
attached to the end.

Example: #alias {k} {kill %1;kick}
Typing 'k orc' would result in attacking the orc followed by a kick.

You can create more complex aliases by using variables in the name section of the alias, which will override the default
variable handling.

Example: #alias {k %1 with %2} {wield %2;attack %1;slash %1 with %2;whirl %2;strike %1 with %2}
Using the above alias you would type something like: k blue smurf with battle axe

To have an alias that match with all user input, use %* as name.

Example: #alias {%*} {#showme You wrote: %0}
Notice: You can remove aliases with the #unalias command.

To remove alias with %* as name, use #unalias {%%*}. Yet, better method would be wrapping the alias inside class, and then
kill that class when you no longer need the alias. That way you prevent wiping all aliases in case you haven't set alias with
%* as name.
