Delay

Syntax: #delay {seconds} {commands}

Syntax: #delay {name} {command} {seconds}

Delay allows you to have tintin wait the given amount of seconds before executing the given command. Floating point numbers for millisecond precision are possible.

The delay command works differently depending on the number of arguments. With three arguments #delay has the same syntax as the #tick command, allowing you to name the delay. If you use a named delay and a delay with the exact same name is currently pending, it will be removed and never execute. Using a named delay also makes it easier to use the #undelay command.

Example: #delay {600} {#showme Check the oven!
This will inform you after 600 seconds to check the oven, preferable to relying on the smoke alarm.

Example: #delay {oven timer} {#showme Check the oven!} {600}
Same as above, instead using a named delay.
