  <Description>
    Variables differ from the %0-99 arguments in that a full word may be used as a variable.
    They stay in memory for the full session unless they are changed.
    They can be saved in the coms file, and can be set to different values if two or more sessions running at the same time.
    Variables are global for each session and can be accessed by adding a '$' before the variable name.
  </Description>
  <Example Usage="#alias {target} {#var target %0}">
    The name of a variable must exist of only letters and numbers in order to be substituted.
    If you do not meet these requirements do not panic.  Simply encapsulate the variable within braces.
  </Example>
  <Example Usage="#alias {x}      {cast 'acid blast' $target}" />
  <Example Usage="#variable {cool website} {http://tintin.sourceforge.net}">
    Chat that you were on ${cool website} yesterday!
    
    Variables can be nested using brackets, causing the variable to behave like an associative array.
  </Example>
  <Example Usage="#var hp[self] 34;#var hp[target] 46">
    You can see the first nest of a variable using $variable[+1] and the last nest using $variable[-1]. Using $variable[-2] will
    report the second last variable, and so on. To show all indices use $variable[].
  </Example>
  <Notes>
    To see the nesting index of a variable use &amp;variable.
    
    In order to check if a variable exists, the '#if {&amp;{variable}}' can be used.

    A non existent nested variable with an existing root variable will report itself as 0.

    Variables can be removed with the '#unvariable' command.
