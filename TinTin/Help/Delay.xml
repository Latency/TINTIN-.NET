  <Command Name="Delay" Modified="2017-09-16" />
  <Syntax>{milliseconds} {commands}</Syntax>
  <Syntax>{name} {command} {milliseconds}</Syntax>
  <Description>
    Allows the process to wait the given amount of milliseconds before executing the given command.

    The delay command works differently depending on the number of arguments. With three arguments #delay has the same syntax as
    the #tick command, allowing you to name the delay.
    
    If you use a named delay and a delay with the exact same name is currently pending, it will be
    removed and never execute. Using a named delay also makes it easier to use the #undelay command.

    Example: #delay {oven timer} {#showme Check the oven!} {600}
    Same as above, instead using a named delay.

  <Example Usage="#delay {60000} {#showme Check the oven!}">
    Informs you after 1 minute to check the oven.
