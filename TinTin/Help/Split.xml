  <Syntax>#split {bottom row} {top row}</Syntax>
  <Description>
    Splits the screen, resulting in the top part of the screen receiving mud output, and the bottom part receiving keyboard input.
    This allows you to type without incoming mud text messing up your prompt.

    If you split your screen it's suggested to capture the prompt and place it on the split line with the prompt command.
    Otherwise, new mud output will be printed over your last prompt.

  <Notes>
    You can remove the split screen with the #unsplit command.
