  <Command Name="Pathdir" />
  <Syntax>{forward direction} {backward direction} {coord}</Syntax>
  <Description>
By default tintin sets the most commonly used movement commands meaning you generally don't really have to bother with
pathdirs. Pathdirs are used by the #path and #map commands.

The first argument is a direction, the second argument is the reversed direction. The reverse direction of north is south, etc.

The third argument is a spatial coordinate. In general, each cardinal direction should have a unique value which is a power
of two (e.g. 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, etc). The exception is for compound directions, whose value should be the sum of the
values for each component direction. For example, if the third value for 'n' is 1, and 'e' is 2, then you would want 'ne' to
have a value of 3 (1 + 2). This value is required for the #map functionality to work.

Example: #pathdir {ue} {dw} {18}
Notice: You can remove pathdirs with the #unpathdir command.
