Wildcards

Wildcards are used for string match searches using regular expressions.

If the regex starts with ^ the beginning of the string must match. If the string ends with a $ the end of the string and
regex must match.

The following options are available for regular expressions.

  { } embed a perl compatible regular expression.

  [ ] . + | ( ) ? * are treated as normal text unlessed used within braces. Keep in mind that { } is replaced with ( ).

  %w match zero to any number of letters.
  %W match zero to any number of non letters.
  %d match zero to any number of digits.
  %D match zero to any number of non digits.
  %s match zero to any number of spaces.
  %S match zero to any number of non spaces.
  
  %? match zero or one character.
  %. match one character.
  %+ match one to any number of characters. 
  %* match zero to any number of characters.
  
  %i match becomes case insensitive.
  %I match becomes case sensitive (default).

Example: #alias {bla%*}
This would display all aliasses starting with 'bla'

Example: #if {"$test" == "%*%ibla%*"} {#showme true}
This checks if the variable test contains the substring 'bla' - regardless of capitalization.
