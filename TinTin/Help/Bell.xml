  <Command Name="Bell" Modified="2017-09-16" />
  <Syntax>#bell</Syntax>
  <Description>
    This command rings the terminal bell. It's obsolete and should be avoided, instead use #showme {\a} to send the terminal
    alarm character to the terminal.
  </Description>
  <Example Usage="#action {Bubba tells you} {#showme {\a\}">
    This could be useful if you aren't watching the screen and don't want to miss out on a conversation with Bubba.
    Alternatively you can use '#system' to play a sound file.
  </Example>
  <Example Usage="#action {Bubba tells you} {#showme {\e]1;New Message\e\\};#delay 10 #showme {\e]1;TinTin# client\e\\}" />
  <Notes>
    Some terminals will allow you to use VT100 Operating System Commands to change the terminal's icon name which can be used as
    a visual alert.
