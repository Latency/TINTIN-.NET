  <Syntax>{message} {commands} {priority}</Syntax>
  <Description>
    The #action command can be used to respond with one or several commands to a specific message send by the mud. The %1-99
    variables are substituted from the message and can be used in the command part of the action. The priority part is optional
    and determines the priority of the action, it defaults to 5.

    If the message starts with ~ color codes must be matched. You can turn on #config convert to display meta characters in
    order to make color triggers.

    If the message starts with ^ the beginning of the action message and mud message must match. If the message ends with a $;
    the end of the action message and server message must match.

    The following support is available for regular expressions.

    Using %1, %2 up to %99 can be used in the message to capture text using a lazy match, the matched
    text is stored and can be used in the command section of the trigger using the corresponding %1
    to %99 variable. By default %0 contains the entire match, though this can be overwritten by using
    %0 in the message part of the trigger.

    Using { } will embed a Perl Compatible Regular Expression, available at the next available numeric
    variable, starting out at %1.

    [ ] . + | ( ) ? * are treated as normal text unlessed used within braces. Keep in mind that { } is
    replaced with ( ).

    Of the following arguments the (lazy) match is available at the next numeric variable.

      %w match zero to any number of letters.
      %W match zero to any number of non letters.
      %d match zero to any number of digits.
      %D match zero to any number of non digits.
      %s match zero to any number of spaces.
      %S match zero to any number of non spaces.

      %? match zero or one character.
      %. match one character.
      %+ match one to any number of characters.
      %* match zero to any number of characters.

      %i match becomes case insensitive.
      %I match becomes case sensitive (default).

  <Notes>
    An action can be removed by using the '#unaction' command.
    To remove an action with %* as a message, use the '#unaction {%%*}'.

    A better method would be to wrap the action inside a class and
    kill that class when no longer needed.  This will prevent erasing all actions in in the event of a set action with %* as its message.

  <Example Usage="#action {%1 tells you '%2'} {tell %1 I'm afk.}">
    When using non numeric variables, the matched text is available at the last used numeric variable + 1.
  </Example>
  <Example Usage="#action {%w tells you '%*'} {tell %1 I'm afk.;say %1 told me: %2}" />
  <Example Usage="#action {%3 tells you '%*'} {tell %3 I'm afk.;say %3 told me: %4}">
    Using a tilda you can create color triggers to capture otherwise difficult to trigger text, to see color codes use:  '#config convert on.'
  </Example>
  <Example Usage="#action {~^\e[1;37m%1} {#showme {--Shown in bold white: %1}}">
    Actions can be triggered by the showme command.
