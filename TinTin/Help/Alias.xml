  <Description>
    The #alias command can be used to shorten up long or oftenly used commands. The %1-99 variables are substituted from the
    arguments when using an alias and represent the 1st till 99th word which can be used in the commands part of the alias.

    If %0 is used it will contain all arguments, if the commands part only exists of a single word, variables are automatically
    attached to the end.
  </Description>
  <Example Usage="#alias {k} {kill %1;kick}">
    Typing 'k orc' would result in attacking the orc followed by a kick.

    You can create more complex aliases by using variables in the name section of the alias, which will override the default
    variable handling.
  </Example>
  <Example Usage="#alias {k %1 with %2} {wield %2;attack %1;slash %1 with %2;whirl %2;strike %1 with %2}">
    Using the above alias you would type something like:  'k blue smurf with battle axe'

    To have an alias that match with all user input, use %* as name.
  </Example>
  <Example Usage="#alias {%*} {#showme You wrote: %0}" />
  <Notes>
    You can remove aliases with the #unalias command.
    To remove an alias with %* as a name, use #unalias {%%*}.

    A better method would be to wrap the action inside a class and kill that class when no longer needed.  This will prevent erasing
    all aliases in in the event of a set alias with %* as its name.
