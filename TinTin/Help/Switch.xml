  <Command Name="Switch" />
  <Syntax>{condition} {arguments}</Syntax>
  <Description>
    Works similar to the switch statement in other languages.
    
    When the #switch command is encountered its body is parsed and each #case command found will be compared to the
    conditional argument of the switch and executed if there is a match.
    
    If the '#default' command is found and no #case statement has been matched the #default command's argument is executed.

    Used to break out of a switch, but is not required like it is in C because only one #case command can be executed per switch.
