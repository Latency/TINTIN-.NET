    A gagged message will no longer be displayed.
  </Description>
  <Example Usage="#gag {%iTwinkie chats}">
    If Twinkie is an annoying person, he'll be a gagged annoying person with this gag.
    
    The %i at the start makes the gag case incensitive, so if Twinkie logs in as TWINKIE the gag will still work.
