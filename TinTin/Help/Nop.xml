  <Command Name="Nop" />
  <Syntax></Syntax>
  <Description>
    The name 'nop' means 'no operation' and is useful as filler instructions.

     Useful for leaving comments in scripts.
     Make sure to avoid using the '{' and '}' characters in that case.

  <Example Usage="#act {&amp;} {#nop} {0}">
    Some muds allow you to separate commands using '&amp;', while still allowing players to use it in says or tells.
    This would allow some devious players to abuse triggers without protection.
    
    If a message contains the '&amp;' character, vulnerable actions will not be triggered.
    Only one action is allowed to be triggered at a time.
