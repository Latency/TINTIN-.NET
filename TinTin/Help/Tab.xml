  <Description>
    The tab command will add the completionword to your tab completion list.
    When pressing the 'tab' key, a search is conducted through the tab list in efforts of finding the best match.
    
    Useful for long commands.

    If tab is pressed, with no tabs defined, a scrollback buffer will be used to look for matches.
