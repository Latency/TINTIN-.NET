  </Example>
  <Example Usage="#buffer {up}">
    Moves your scrollback buffer up one page and displays the page.
    Enables scroll lock mode.
    Most useful when used in a macro.
  </Example>
  <Example Usage="#buffer {down}">
    Moves your scrollback buffer down one page and displays the page.
    Enables scroll lock mode unless at the end.
    Most useful when used in a macro.
  </Example>
  <Example Usage="#buffer {end}">
    Moves you to the end of your scrollback buffer and displays the page.
    Disables scroll lock mode.
    Most useful when used in a macro.
  </Example>
  <Example Usage="#buffer {find} {[number]} {&lt;string&gt;}">
    Moves the buffer to the given string which may contain a regular expressions.
    Optionally you can provide the number of matches to skip, allowing you to jump further back in the buffer.
  </Example>
  <Example Usage="#buffer {get} {&lt;variable&gt;} {&lt;lower bound&gt;} {[upper bound]}">
    Allows you to store one or several lines from your scrollback buffer (including color codes) into a variable.
    The lower and upper bound must be between 1 and the size of the buffer.
    If the upper bound is omitted the given line is stored as a standard variable.
    If an upper bound is given the lines between the two bounds are stored as a list.
  </Example>
  <Example Usage="#buffer {lock}">
    Toggles the lock on the scrollback buffer.
    When locked, newly incoming text won't be displayed.
    Any command will disable the lock, though several buffer commands will re-enable the lock.
    When unlocking, it'll move you to the end of your scrollback buffer and display the page.
  </Example>
  <Example Usage="#buffer {write} {&lt;filename&gt;}">
    Writes the scrollback buffer to the given file.
  </Example>
  <Example Usage="#buffer {info}">
    Shows some statistics of the shared string memory system used by the scrollback buffer to conserve memory.
  </Example>
  <Example Usage="#macro {(press ctrl-v)(press F1)} {#buffer end}">
    Associates F1 key to 'scroll buffer to its end' command.
  </Example>
  <Example>
    #act {^[Exits: %1]} {
      #loop 2 20 loop {
        #buffer get name $loop;
        #if {"$name" == "\e[1;33m%*"} {
          #var roomname &amp;1;
          #break
        }
      }
    }

    When the Exits: line shows up, loop through the last 20 lines of the buffer looking for a bold yellow (\e[1;33m) room name.
    Knowing the name of the room you are in can be useful when mapping.
