  <Description>
The function command is used much like a variable, except that you can pass along arguments. You can execute commands inside
a function, and after the function is finished the line that called the function has the function call replaced with whatever
the $result variable holds.

The result variable is also used in the echo command, so you should be careful when using #echo inside a function. You can
use a function by calling it with: @&lt;functionname&gt;{&lt;arguments&gt;} the arguments are stored in %0 to %99, with %0 holding all
arguments, %1 the first, %2 the second, etc. The arguments are separated by encasing the arguments in braces, or using
semicolons.

  <Example Usage="#function {time}
    {
      #if {%0==string.Empty} {
        #format {epoch} {%T}
      };
      #else {
        #var epoch %0
      };
      #format {result} {%t} {{%T}{$epoch}
    }">
    The #if conditional in the function, will check if an argument has been passed.
    If so, the argument which is assumed to be a timestamp, is stored in $epoch.
    If not, the current number of seconds since 1970 is retrieved with '#format {epoch} %T'.
    Next, $epoch is used to store the current time in $result.

    Using:  '#showme @time{}' will display the current military time.

    The '#unfunction' command removes functions.
