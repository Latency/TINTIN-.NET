  <Description>
    Provides various line based operations.
  </Description>
  <Example Usage="#line {gag}">
    When called the next to be displayed line will be gagged.

    As actions trigger before the line they trigger on is displayed, using '#line gag' within an action will cause the triggering line not to be displayed.
  </Example>
  <Example Usage="#line {log} {&lt;filename&gt;} {[text]}">
    Logs the given text to the given filename.

    If no text argument is given, the next to be displayed line will be logged to the given file.
    If any color codes are used in the text argument, they'll be translated to ANSI color codes.

    The logging format will be either HTML, RAW, or PLAIN depending on the #config {LOG} setting.
  </Example>
  <Example Usage="#line {logverbatim} {&lt;filename&gt;} {[text]}">
    Works exactly like #line log, except that color codes, variables, and functions in the text argument won't be substituted.
  </Example>
  <Example Usage="#var ignore_list {{Bubba}{1}{Pamela}{1}};" />
  <Example Usage="
    #act {%1 tells you '%2'} {
      #if {&amp;ignore_list[%1]} {
        #line gag
      }
      #line logverbatim tells.log
    }">
    Logs all tells to the tells.log file, unless the sender is on the ignore list, in which case the tell is gagged.
