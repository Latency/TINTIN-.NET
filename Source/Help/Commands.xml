Command Syntax

All TinTin# commands start with a '#' unless you redefine it with the #config command. If you load a script file with the
#read command the first character of the file will be set as the command character. All TinTin# commands can be abbreviated.

Commands Seperator

You can separate commands with the ';' character. If you want to use this character as mud output precede it with the escape
character '\'. To escape an entire line start the line the escape character '\'. To have all input send to the server as is
(except for aliases) use: #config {verbatim} {on}.

Example: smile;say hello \;)
This would makes you smile, followed by say hello ;)
