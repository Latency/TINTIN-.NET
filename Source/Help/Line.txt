Line

Syntax: #line {option} {argument}

The line command provides various line based operations.

#line {gag}

When called the next to be displayed line will be gagged. As actions trigger before the line they trigger on is displayed,
using #line gag within an action will cause the triggering line not to be displayed.

#line {log} {<filename>} {[text]}

#line log logs the given text to the given filename. If no text argument is given, the next to be displayed line will be
logged to the given file. If any TinTin# color codes are used in the text argument they'll be translated to ANSI color codes.
The logging format will be either HTML, RAW, or PLAIN depending on the #config {LOG} setting.

#line {logverbatim} {<filename>} {[text]}

#line logverbatim works exactly like #line log, except that color codes, variables, and functions in the text argument won't
be substituted.

Example: 

#var ignore_list {{Bubba}{1}{Pamela}{1}};

#act {%1 tells you '%2'}
{
  #if {&ignore_list[%1]}
  {
 	#line gag
  }
  {
    #line logverbatim tells.log
  }
}
The above example will log all tells to the tells.log file, unless the sender is on the ignore list, in which case the tell
is gagged.
