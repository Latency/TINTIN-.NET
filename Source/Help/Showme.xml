  <Command Name="Showme" Modified="9/16/2017" />
  <Syntax>{message} {line number}</Syntax>
  <Description>
Messages displayed by the showme command can be triggered, and can be used to debug actions, substitutions, etc. Since
variables are substituted as well this can also be used to display information.

Example: #showme $bla
If you have the variable 'bla' defined this would show whatever bla has been set to.

The line number is optional, and works the same way as the line number in the #prompt command.
