  <Description>
The name 'nop' means 'no operation' and is useful if you don't want to do a thing.

Example: #act {&amp;} {#nop} {0}
Some muds allow you to separate commands using '&amp;', while still allowing players to use it in says or tells. This would allow
some devious players to abuse you triggers without this protection. So if a message contains the '&amp;' character vulnerable
actions will not be triggered, since only 1 action is allowed to be triggered at a time.

You can also use #nop to leave comments in scripts, make sure to avoid using the '{' and '}' characters in that case.
