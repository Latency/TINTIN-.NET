  <Description>
This will read in a file and send each line to the mud. The text will not be parsed by tintin. Useful to dump a script file
into a mud's note editor or something of that order. Remember that most muds will close your connection if you send too much
data.

Example: #textin desc1.txt
Would load the data of desc1 in an olc editor or something.
