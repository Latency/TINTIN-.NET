  <Description>
The kill command will delete every node in every list. This includes a marked path, pathdirs, and configurations. Useful if
you want to read in a new script file and want to start out clean.

Using kill with a given list will delete the specified list, for example: #kill alias

Additionally you can give both a list and an argument, in which case only the matching triggers in a list will be killed, for
example: #kill alias %*bla%*
