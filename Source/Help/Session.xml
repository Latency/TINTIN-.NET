  <Syntax>{name} {address} {port}</Syntax>
  <Description>
Will start a session with the given name, connecting to the specified address and port.

Example: #ses twinkie neverneverland.bla 1234
Ofcourse you'd have to fill in something else if you actually want to go somewhere. The Mud connector offers a large
searchable list of muds.

Other options are #session + and - to go to the next or previous session. This only works if you are multiplaying.
#session &lt;number&gt; activates the session corresponding to the given number.
