  <Command Name="Switch" Modified="9/16/2017" />
  <Syntax>{condition} {arguments}</Syntax>
  <Description>
The #switch command works similar to the switch statement in other languages. When the #switch command is encountered its
body is parsed and each #case command found will be compared to the conditional argument of the switch and executed if there
is a match. If the #default command is found and no #case statement has been matched the #default command's argument is
executed.

The #break command can be used to break out of a switch, but is not required like it is in C because only one #case command
can be executed per switch.

Example: #switch {1d4} {#case 1 cackle;#case 2 smile;#default giggle}
