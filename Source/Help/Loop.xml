  <Command Name="Loop" Modified="9/16/2017" />
  <Syntax>{min} {max} {variable} {commands}</Syntax>
  <Description>
The loop command works like a simplified for loop in c. The min and max arguments should be numbers. The command will
increment or decrement (depending on the numbers) untill the second number is reached. For every in/de-cremention the
commands part will be executed. The value of the in/de-cremention counter will be stored in the variable and can be used in
the commands part.

Example: #loop 1 10 cnt {say $cnt}
This equals: say 1;say 2;say 3 ... say 9;say 10
