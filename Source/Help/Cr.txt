Cr

Syntax: #cr

This command sends a carriage return to the mud. It's obsolete and should be avoided. Useful if you have the repeat enter
config option enabled and need an enter without repeating your last command. Alternatively you can use #send without an
argument, or two consecutive command separators ;; to insert an enter. If you want to send multiple returns on a server,
it's best to use #send { \n \n } (three enters total) since some treat consecutive returns as a single return.

Example: #ticker {idle} {#cr} {300}
This will send a carriage return to the mud every 300 seconds (5 minuts) which will stop most muds and networks from
disconnecting you for inactivity.
