Session

Syntax: #session {name} {address} {port}

Will start a session with the given name, connecting to the specified address and port.

Example: #ses twinkie neverneverland.bla 1234
Ofcourse you'd have to fill in something else if you actually want to go somewhere. The Mud connector offers a large
searchable list of muds.

Other options are #session + and - to go to the next or previous session. This only works if you are multiplaying.
#session <number> activates the session corresponding to the given number.
